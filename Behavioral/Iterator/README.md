I skipped 'iterator' pattern due to the reasons below.

1. Generic-style 'iterator' pattern (like STL iterator) are more better than OOP-style 'iterator' pattern.
2. I think that the case that OOP-style 'iterator' pattern is needed is very rare because 'dynamic polymorphism' is not needed related to 'iterator' in most cases.
   ('static polymorphism' is sufficient.)
